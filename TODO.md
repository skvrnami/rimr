# TO DO:

## Particular stuff:  

* add tests
* check tolerance bounds (is it necessary to make +- tolerance for checking approximate year of birth?)
* check similarity of last names of women after getting married (could they be separated by dash?)
* https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#filters (filtering for substrings and regex)

## Conceptual:

* How to compare across multiple election (recursive matching) 
* connecting filters with OR?
* allow methods other than strict equality for finding the most similar person (when there are more than 1 similar person)

## Graphical outputs [outside of package]:

* D3 animation (circles moving between groups) or [this](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/2018/03/recreate-sankey-flow-chart/)
* Sankey chart
* missing values (those who did not run) - pseudo heatmap

## Data
* API to retrieve data from SQLite
